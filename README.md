# ChinookEscapement-RunSize

# Title of Dataset:
Chinook salmon escapement data for 81 populations, and total run size for 23 populations from the Fraser River to the Sacramento

## Description of the Data and file structure

These datasets include (1) escapement estimates for 81 Chinook salmon populations across the timeseries of monitoring. Timeseries length varies by population. 
Data on escapement includes population name, population number in our analysis, the conservation unit (cons_unit), the run timing of the population, year, as well as hatchery, wild, and total spawner abundance. 

(2) Data on total run sizes, which were generated using PSC and PFMC estimates of harvest rates to expand escapement to total run size for 23 populations where the 
harvest data was available.
